# custom-questions-controller
This is the controller for a drag-and-drop feature I developed during my employment at Servmetrics Ltd. The component is used to customize the SMS survey sent to customers by allowing the user to select five survey questions from the available pool. The user can change the questions at any time and rearrange the order in which they appear.
